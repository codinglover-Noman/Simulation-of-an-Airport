# Simulation-of-an-Airport
As a specific example, let us consider a small but busy airport with only one runway. In each unit of time, one plane can land or one plane can take off but not both. Planes arrive ready to land or to take off at random times, so at any given unit of time, the runway may be idle or a plane may be landing or taking off and there may be several planes waiting either to land or take off. We, therefore, need two queues, called landing and takeoff, to hold these planes. It is better to keep a plane waiting on the ground than in the air, so a small airport allows a plane to take off only if no planes are waiting to land. Hence, after receiving requests from new planes to land or take off, our simulation will first service the head of the queue of planes waiting to land, and only if the landing queue is empty will it allow a plane to take off. We shall wish to simulate many units of time, and, therefore, we embed the main action of the program in a loop that runs for the current time from 1 to a variable end time. With this notation, we can write an outline of the main program.
